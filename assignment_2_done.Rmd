You will have to create 3 plots based on the datasets and instructions detailed below. You will find the plots themeselves in the `assignments/assignment_2_plots`. Your task is to write the code that will reproduce the plots as closely as possible.

# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr), and working with factors (forcats)
-   Data visuzlization (ggplot2)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
rm(list=ls())
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytuesdayR)
```

## Task 1: Climbing expeditions

The 2020-09-22 TidyTueday datasets are about climbing expeditions. From the three datasets, use the "expeditions". Reproduce the plot below! Notice a few things:

-   Use `forcats::fct_lump()` to get the 15 most frequent peaks, and drop the "Other" category.
-   The bars are ordered by the sum of all expeditions (use `fct_reorder()`).
-   The bar colors use the viridis palette and light theme.

```{r}
library(forcats)
library(ggplot2)

#tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2020-09-22') #API limit reached...

data <- tuesdata$expeditions

#top 15 peaks and dropping the category other then counting
frequent_peaks <- data %>%
  mutate(data_filt = fct_lump(peak_name, n = 15)) %>%
  filter(data_filt != "Other") %>%
  count(data_filt, name = 'number_of_exp')

frequent_peaks <- frequent_peaks%>%
  arrange((number_of_exp))

fp <- unique(frequent_peaks$data_filt) #for the order

frequent_peaks_by_season <- data %>%
  mutate(data_filt = fct_lump(peak_name, n = 15)) %>%
  filter(data_filt != "Other") %>%
  group_by(data_filt, season) %>% #group by peak and season
  summarize(number_of_exp = n(), .groups = "drop") #count occurrences per group



ggplot(frequent_peaks_by_season, aes(x = factor(data_filt, levels = fp), y = number_of_exp, fill = season)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "stack") + #defining bars
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "D") +             #viridis
  theme_light() +                                  #light theme
  labs(
    title = "Top 15 most popular peaks stacked by season of expedition",  #title
    x = "",   #no X-axis (this would be the y)
    y = "Number of Expeditions",  #y-axis label
    fill = "Season"  #the given parameter
  ) +
  theme(
    legend.position = "bottom"   #modify position
  ) +
   coord_flip() #coordinate transformation


```

## Task 2: PhDs awarded

The 2019-02-19 TidyTueday dataset is about phd-s awarded by year and field. There is only one dataset, it is called `phd_by_field`. Reproduce the plot below!

Notes:

-   First you have to aggregate the data to count all phd-s by broad fields.
-   To make the x axis breaks pretty, use `scales::pretty_breaks()`, to make the y axis labels comma formatted, use `scales::comma_format()`.
-   The line size is 1.2, the colors are from the brewer "Dark2" palette. The theme is set to minimal.

```{r}
library(forcats)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales) 
library(RColorBrewer) 

#tuesdata2 <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2019-02-19') #API limit reached...
data2 <- read_csv("C:/Users/Hegedüs Anna/Documents/Fall-2024/data/phd_by_field.csv")

phd_groupping <- data2 %>%
  group_by(broad_field, year) %>%    #group by broad field and year
  summarize(number_of_phds = sum(n_phds, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") #count 


ggplot(phd_groupping, aes(x = year, y = number_of_phds, color = broad_field, group = broad_field)) +
  geom_line(linewidth  = 1.2) +  #set line size
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +  #use Dark2 color palette from RColorBrewer
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = pretty_breaks(n = 5)) +  #set pretty breaks for x-axis
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma_format()) +  #format y-axis labels with commas
  theme_minimal() +  #use minimal theme
  labs(
    title = "Number of awarded Ph.D.-s in the US by year",
    x = "",
    y = "",
    color = "Broad field"
  )

```

## Task 3: Commute in the US

The 2019-11-05 TidyTueday dataset is about commuting to work in each city in the US by bike or on foot. There is only one dataset, it is called `commute`. Reproduce the plot below!

Notes:

-   First you have to aggregate the data to count all commutes by state.
-   Both axis scales are log transformed and the labels comma formatted, using `scales::comma_format()`
-   The point size is 2, . The theme is set to light.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)



#tuesdata3 <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2019-11-05') 
data3 <- read_csv("C:/Users/Hegedüs Anna/Documents/Fall-2024/data/commute.csv")  # note : state name abbreviations not provided

#states names provided in built in R
state_table <- data.frame(
  state = state.name,
  state_abb = state.abb
  )


commute_groupping <- data3 %>%
  group_by(state, mode, state_region) %>% # Group by broad field and year
  summarize(number_of_commuters = sum(n, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") # Count 

#make a scatter plot, so a merging is needed
d3_1 = commute_groupping[commute_groupping$mode == 'Bike' ,] 
d3_2 = commute_groupping[commute_groupping$mode == 'Walk' ,]


#Note : Because the abbreviations are not provided DC is lost....
#Note2 : Because the criteria of the plotted text abbs not given, using the built on check overlap argument, but the results are not same. What is the criteria??


merged = merge(d3_1, d3_2, by = c('state', 'state_region'))

#with these steps the capital can be saved
DC = merged[merged$state == 'District of Columbia', ]
DC$state_abb = 'DC'
merged = merge(merged, state_table, by = c('state'))
merged = rbind(merged, DC)


#calculate the log (not needed because built in scale_log functions)
# merged$walk_log = log(merged$number_of_commuters.y)
# merged$bike_log = log(merged$number_of_commuters.x)
merged$walk_log = (merged$number_of_commuters.y)
merged$bike_log = (merged$number_of_commuters.x)






ggplot(merged, aes(x = walk_log, y = bike_log, color = state_region)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +  # Set point size
  scale_x_log10(labels = comma_format()) +  # Log scale for x-axis with comma format
  scale_y_log10(labels = comma_format()) + # Log scale for y-axis with comma format
  geom_text(aes(label = state_abb), color = "black", size = 5, check_overlap = TRUE) +
  theme_light() +  # Use light theme
  labs(
    x = "Number of ppl walking to work (log N)", 
    y = "Number of ppl biking to work (log N)", 
    title = "Title number of people walking vs biking to work in each USA state",  #note, the Title part could be a typo here
    color = "State region"
  )





#done



```
