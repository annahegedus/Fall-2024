# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}
#load the necessary library
library(tidyverse)

#load the dataset
cocktail_data <- read_tsv("C:/Users/HegedÃ¼s Anna/Downloads/cocktail_data.tsv")

#check out what the data looks like
head(cocktail_data)
```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}
#cleaning the dataset
cocktail_data_formatted <- cocktail_data %>%      
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = ", ") %>%  # Ingredients into separate rows
  mutate(
    ingredients = str_remove_all(ingredients,"<.*?>|\\(.*?\\)|\\d+/?\\d*\\s*(oz|dashes)|%\\s*abv|drops|\\b\\d+\\b|^\\.$|^$|-proof"),  
    ingredients = str_squish(ingredients)) %>%     
    filter(ingredients != "", ingredients != ".") #remove unwanted spaces and characters

head(cocktail_data_formatted)
```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}
#create a list of ingrediens
ingredients_list <- cocktail_data_formatted %>% 
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = " ") %>%   #all ingredeints into a new row
  distinct(ingredients) %>%       #list every item once
  arrange(ingredients)            #arrange to alphabetical order
  

ingredients_list
```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
nrow(ingredients_list)      #count the number of rows
```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}
top_ingredients <- cocktail_data_formatted %>%
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = " ") %>%   #necessary because all cocktail's whole recipe was in one cell, and was counted as 1
  count(ingredients, sort = TRUE) %>%      #count how many times each ingredient is listed, put them in a descending order
  head(10)                                #show the first 10 items in the list

print(top_ingredients)
```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}
blabla


```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

```{r}



```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}

```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
  
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r}

```

Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
