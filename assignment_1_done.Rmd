# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}
library(readr)

#defining the raw path to the file
d_url <- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/refs/heads/master/cocktail_data.tsv'

#reading and printing the file
data <- read_tsv(d_url)
head(data)

```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)

cleaned_table <- data %>%
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = "<br/>|<br>|<b4/>") %>% #separation of ingredients into separate rows
  mutate(
      ingredient_clean = str_extract(ingredients, "\\s*[a-zA-Z]+\\s*([^\\(]*)"),   #remove unwanted characters
      ingredient_clean = str_remove_all(ingredient_clean, "\\boz\\b|\\bdrops?\\b|\\bdashes?\\b|\\d+(\\.\\d+)?%\\s*abv"), #remove 'oz', 'drop', 'drops', 'dash', 'dashes', 'abv'
      ingredient_clean = str_squish(ingredient_clean),  #remove unwanted spaces
      ingredient_clean = tolower(ingredient_clean)  #capitals to lowercase
    ) %>%
  
#remove empty rows or rows with no ingredients
  filter(!is.na(ingredient_clean), ingredient_clean != "")

#review the cleaned table 
head(cleaned_table) 
```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}
#getting the unique ingredients
unique_ing <- sort(unique(cleaned_table$ingredient_clean))

#checking if requirements are met
print(unique_ing) 
```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
#getting the length of the list
num_unique_ing <- length(unique_ing)

#checking the results
print(num_unique_ing) 
```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}

top_10_ingr <- cleaned_table %>%
  count(ingredient_clean, name = "Number", sort = TRUE) %>% #count ingredient frequencies
  arrange(desc(Number))

#get the 10th largest usage value (to account for ties)
largest_usage <- top_10_ingr$Number[10]

#list ingredients with frequency >= the 10th largest value
top_10_ingr <- top_10_ingr %>%
  filter(Number >= largest_usage)

#printing
print(top_10_ingr)
```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}
library(dplyr)

#count the number of ingredients for each cocktail
results_df2 <- cleaned_table %>%
  group_by(name) %>%   #group by cocktail name
  summarise(Number = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%  #count the nr. of ingredients per cocktail
  filter(Number == max(Number))  #filter cocktails with max. number of ingredients

#get names of cocktails with the most ingredients
cocktails_most_ing <- results_df2$name

#check results
print(cocktails_most_ing)
```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

```{r}

#creating an empty dataframe
results_df <- data.frame(Number = numeric(0), Ingredient = character(0), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

for (i in 1:num_unique_ing){
  
  ing_current <- unique_ing[i] #defining the given ingredient
  
  c_current <- cleaned_table[(cleaned_table$ingredient_clean == ing_current), ] #filtering
  
  usage <- length(c_current$ingredient_clean) #counting
  
  results_df <- rbind(results_df, data.frame(Number = usage, Ingredient = ing_current))
  
}

#sorting
results_df <- results_df[(results_df$Number == 1), ]

rare_ing <- results_df$Ingredient

print(rare_ing)
print(length(rare_ing))

```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}

#creating an empty dataframe
results_df3 <- data.frame(Ingredient = character(0), Cocktail = character(0), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

for (i in 1:length(rare_ing)){
  
  ing_current <- rare_ing[i] #defining the given ingredient
  
  c_current_df <- cleaned_table[(cleaned_table$ingredient_clean == ing_current), ] #filtering
  
  cocktail_name <- c_current_df$name #defining
  
  results_df3 <- rbind(results_df3, data.frame(Cocktail = cocktail_name, Ingredient = ing_current))
  
}

cocktails_with_rare <- results_df3$Cocktail

print(cocktails_with_rare)

```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
#without rare = all - with_rare
#the previous one could have been easily solved with %in% but the loop was already there so I did not think of that

without_rare <- cleaned_table[!(cleaned_table$name%in%cocktails_with_rare), ] #filtering
without_rare_cocktails <- unique(without_rare$name)

print(without_rare_cocktails)
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. <Example:getwd>()

```{r}

all_cocktails <- unique(cleaned_table$name)
all_ings <- unique(cleaned_table$ingredient_clean)

# Create a matrix

#For an empty cell I know there should be this code:
#data_matrix <- matrix(character(0), nrow = length(all_cocktails), ncol = length(all_ings))getwd()

#however NA looks worse than a simple 0, so I prefer using this:
data_matrix <- matrix('0', nrow = length(all_cocktails), ncol = length(all_ings))

# Assign column names from list1 and row names from list2
colnames(data_matrix) <- all_ings
rownames(data_matrix) <- all_cocktails

for (i in 1:length(all_cocktails)){
  for (ii in 1:length(all_ings)){
    
    df_current = cleaned_table[cleaned_table$name == all_cocktails[i],]
    df_current2 = df_current[df_current$ingredient_clean == all_ings[ii],]
    
    if (length(df_current2$name) != 0){
      data_matrix[all_cocktails[i], all_ings[ii]] = 'X'
    }
  }
}
  



# Print the matrix
print(data_matrix)




```

Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
